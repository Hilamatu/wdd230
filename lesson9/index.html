            <p>Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a 
                toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have 
                some control as they stood on the board and glided downhill. Dubbed the "snurfer" (combining snow and 
                surfer) by his wife Nancy, the toy proved so popular among his daughters' friends that Poppen licensed 
                the idea to a manufacturer, Brunswick Corporation, that sold about a million snurfers over the next 
                decade. And, in 1966 alone, over half a million snurfers were sold.<br><br>

                In February 1968, Poppen organized the first snurfing competition at a Michigan ski resort that 
                attracted enthusiasts from all over the country.[6] One of those early pioneers was Tom Sims, a 
                devotee of skateboarding (a sport born in the 1950s when kids attached roller skate wheels to small 
                boards that they steered by shifting their weight). As an eighth grader in Haddonfield, New Jersey, 
                in the 1960s, Sims crafted a snowboard in his school shop class by gluing carpet to the top of a piece
                 of wood and attaching aluminum sheeting to the bottom.[7] He produced commercial snowboards in the 
                 mid-70s.<br><br>
                 Also during this same period, in 1977, Jake Burton Carpenter, a Vermont native who had enjoyed 
                 snurfing since the age of 14, impressed the crowd at a Michigan snurfing competition with bindings 
                 he had designed to secure his feet to the board. That same year, he founded Burton Snowboards in 
                 Londonderry, Vermont. The "snowboards" were made of wooden planks that were flexible and had 
                 water ski foot traps. Very few people picked up snowboarding because the price of the board was 
                 considered too high at $38 and were not allowed on many ski hills, but eventually Burton would 
                 become the biggest snowboarding company in the business. Burton's early designs for boards 
                 with bindings became the dominant features in snowboarding.<br><br>
                And then, the snowboarding that we all know today begin to take form and at the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, 
                Snowboarding became an official Olympic event.
