            <h2>History of Omihachiman</h2>
            <p>Ōmihachiman is part of ancient Ōmi Province and was originally a post station that developed around 
                Musa-juku on the Tōsandō (later the Nakasendō) highway connecting Heian-kyō with the eastern provinces
                . During the Sengoku period, the warlord Oda Nobunaga built Azuchi Castle in the hills on the border 
                with Higashiōmi. Under Toyotomi Hidetsugu the center shirted to a castle town at the base of 
                Hachimanyama Castle, which attracted many merchants ("Ōmi shōnin"), especially after the destruction 
                of Azuchi Castle. Former merchant's residences and a canal used for transport are preserved in an old 
                city area, designated a Preservation District for Groups of Traditional Buildings and an Important 
                Cultural Landscape.<br><br>

                The town of Hachiman was established with Gamō District, Shiga with the creation of the modern 
                municipalities system on April 1, 1889. In 1905, an American architect William Merrell Vories came to 
                Ōmihachiman as an English language teacher at commercial high school. Two years later he resigned the 
                original work, but he remained in Ōmihachiman and spent most of his productive life here. He handed 
                down western-style buildings, a pharmaceutical company, an educational foundation and a hospital to the 
                city. The town expanded by annexing the neighboring villages of Utsuro in 1933 and Shima in 1951. On 
                March 31, 1954, Hachiman merged with the villages of Okayama, Kanada, Kirihara and Mabuchi to form the 
                city of Ōmihachiman. The name was changed from "Hachiman" to "Ōmihachiman" to avoid confusion with the 
                then existing city of Yahata in Fukuoka Prefecture, as both "Hachiman" and "Yawata" are written in the 
                same kanji characters. On March 21, 2010, the town of Azuchi was merged into Ōmihachiman.</p>

                <p>If you are a fan of history and culture, you need to visit the ruins of the Azuchi castle the castle 
                    of the warlordn "Oda Nobunaga". Oda Nobunaga indirectly prepared Japan to be a country with freedom
                    of religion.<br>
                    Azuchi Castle (安土城, Azuchi-jō) was one of the primary castles of Oda Nobunaga located in the Azuchi 
                    neighborhood of the city of Ōmihachiman, Shiga Prefecture. The site of the castle was designated a National 
                    Historic Site in 1926, with the designation upgraded to that of a Special National Historic Site in 1952.
                    The castle is located within the grounds of the Biwako Quasi-National Park.<br><br>

                    Azuchi Castle was built from 1576 to 1579 on Mount Azuchi on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa in 
                    Ōmi Province. Nobunaga intentionally built Azuchi Castle close enough to Kyoto that he could 
                    watch over and guard the approaches to the capital, but outside Kyoto so his fortress would be 
                    immune to the fires and conflicts that occasionally consumed the city. Azuchi Castle's location 
                    was also strategically advantageous in managing the communications and transportation routes 
                    between Nobunaga's greatest foes – the Uesugi to the north, the Takeda in the east, and the Mōri 
                    to the west. Azuchi Castle was demolished in 1582 by Akechi Mitsuhide after his assassination of 
                    Nobunaga in the Honno-ji Incident.<br><br>

                    The Azuchi-Momoyama period of Japanese history partially takes its name from Azuchi Castle.
