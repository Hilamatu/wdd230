            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
            <h4>DC Shoes</h4>

            <p>When you open the webpage, the biggest thing and the first thing that 
                catches your attention is the picture of the guy snowboarding. Since the 
                winter is coming and the snowboarding season will start soon, they are 
                leading the visitors to their snowboarding products so I believe that the 
                principle of Visual Hierarchy is well exemplified on this webpage.

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <h4>Plan B</h4>

                <img src="/lesson2/images/planb.PNG" alt="Plan B website screenshot">
            </picture>
            <p>The plan B brand is a brand that is focused on skateboard decks but they also
                sell skateboard wheels and accessories and they have decks of different types and sizes.
                But on their webpage, you can apply the filter search by product, by size, by series, and by riders
                since they have pro model decks. So, the Hick's law is well applied here.</p>

            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <h4>Street League Skateboarding</h4>
            <a href="https://www.streetleague.com">streetleague.com</a>

            </picture>
            <p>The Street League Skateboarding is a website with a lot of information. you
                have videos, resutls from past competition, when and where will be the next tour, and 
                you can buy your tickets. the main focus of them is to sell the tickets and you can see 
                the Fitt's Law well applied with the buttons "Coming soon" and "Buy now" because the 
                button's color is different and the letters are capitalized, making it easier to find 
                and to hit.
